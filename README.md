# WebFTP

**React + Elector FTP client**

This is a "for fun" proof of concept project and serves as a nice example of using node APIs (reading files, ftp connection, etc.) and combining it with a easily stylable web interface, file/FTP structure cache, animations and more...
The project is far from being production ready, and I have no intention to ever make it production ready.  

`npm run dev` for development mode (start Electron dev mode + React dev mode).  
`npm run pack` for React production build & packaging Electron App into a dist folder (still needs some tweaking around to work correctly).

File structure is based on [CRA](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). Electron starter can be found at `public/electron-starter.js`.
